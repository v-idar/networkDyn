## Network dynamics
This repo contains handins in a course in network dynamics. 
* __Handin1:__ Ranking the centrality of economic sectors based on an input output consumption model and using _in and out centrality_, _eigenvector centrality_ and _katz centrality_. We also investigate the
  influence on twitter (X) based on PageRank centrality and investigated how the discrete time consensus algorith changed based on the centrality of the nodes.  
* __Handin2__: Studying the traffic flow in a subset of roads in LA. Computing maximum flow, minimum distance, social optimum, wardrop equilibrium and system optimum. MATLABs convex CVX functions were used.
* __Handin3__: Studying __Single-particle random walk__. Computed metrics such as, return time, hitting time. Also studied __graph colouring__ and __network games__. Assigning routers to frequency bands and couloring a graph.
* __Handin4__: Simulating and studying the pandemic network of the H1N1 virus in 2009. Contained exercises such as simulating a pandemic on a graph, generating a random graph, simulate disease propagation with and without vaccines.
